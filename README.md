TwURL-Search
============

Bookmarklet to search Twitter for the URL of the site you&#39;re on

1. Drag [this link](javascript:(function(){var%20d=document,l=d.location;open(l.protocol+'//twitter.com/search/realtime?q='+encodeURIComponent(l.href),'targetname');})()) into your bookmarks bar as a "bookmarklet". I named it "TwURL" in my bookmarks bar.
2. Load up a the website that you'd like to find shares about.
3. Click the bookmarklet you just created to search on Twitter.
